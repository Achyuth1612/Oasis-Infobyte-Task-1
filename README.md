Iris Flower Classification

The task is to classify iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on their measurements. A machine learning model will be trained using the provided dataset of iris flower measurements to learn the patterns and relationships between the measurements and the species. This will enable the model to accurately classify new, unseen iris flowers based on their measurements.
